# FIFO - first in first out
# imagine real life like bank queue or mcdonalds lines

# Implementation USING DEQUE

    # Queue is a FIFO data structure -- first-in, first-out.
    # Deque is a double-ended queue, but we can use it for our queue.
    # We use append() to enqueue an item, and popleft() to dequeue an item.

        # from collections import deque
        # my_queue = deque()
        # my_queue.append(5)
        # my_queue.append(10)
        # print(my_queue)
        # print(my_queue.popleft())

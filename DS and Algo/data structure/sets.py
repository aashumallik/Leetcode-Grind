# sets
    # they are not duplicate items
    # very fast than list - because you have to start at first when looking in a list
    # they are un ordered
    # very good for doing math operations

# creating a set - uses curly braces
    # x = {1,2,3}
    # print (x)

    # y=set()
    # print(y)

    # list = [1,2]
    # x=set(list)
    # print(x)

# set operations
    # x={1,2,3}
    # x.add(4)
    # x.remove(1)
    # print (x)

    # length of set = len(x)
    # check memberhship in x = print(2 in x) - returns a Boolean
    # delete all the items in set = x.clear
